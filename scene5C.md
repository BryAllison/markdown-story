### âœ… Well done detective!

"LISA HELPED ME!" Keenan shouts very loudly.

"She found out the same time that I did and she caught me as I was walking outside the club and showed me a rough copy of a book that she wrote."

Turns out Lisa was writing a book on how to get away with murder. 

She who was obviously upset about the fact that Tom got another woman pregnant.

You go to her interrogation room and she states that she always wanted a baby with Tom but he said he wasn't ready. 

There was obviously a lot of anger involved in the murder of Brittney Kearson. 

Lisa was uncontrollable and Tom knew it. She would play tricks on the staff where they ended up quitting or seriously hurt. She was not right in the head.

Keenan smiled once Lisa showed him the book and they began planning everything right then and there as that night was the oerfect time to do it and create alibis. 

That's it. It was the angry husband and the psychotic girlfriend that teamed up and killed a woman and her child. 

KEENAN AND LISA DUNNIT!
