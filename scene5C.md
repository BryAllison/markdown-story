"RACHEL HELPED ME!" Tom shouts very loudly.

"She wanted the position Brittney had and I was sleeping with her as well" 

PLOT TWIST

Rachel  was let go because you assumed she had no motive due to all the inconsistencies in the other's stories. You never even gave it a thought for her to be a suspect.

YOU HAVE LET A MURDER WALKED! 

POOR DETECTIVE WORK EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE CAUGHT ONE OF THE KILLERS!
