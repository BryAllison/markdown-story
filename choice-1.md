## EPISODE 1 - WHERE TO BEGIN

You are Mr. WHODUNNIT and you have found a clue that points to the killer being your long-term friend, Tom Peterson. You also happen to know that Tom and the victim was having an affair for a while and that she had recently found out that she was pregnant with Tom's baby due to Tom's girlfriend hiring you to see what he has been up to.

Knowing what you know, what will you do? (The clue that you have found is a silver and gold signature TP cufflink.)
