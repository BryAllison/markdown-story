### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Investigating the house 

You continue your investigation by doing a sweep of the house. You go room-to-room searching for anything that might aid your investigation. 

You don't find anything until you stumble into the ***Laundry Room.*** 

You come across a blood-stained white T-shirt and a pair of black slacks. There is a empty bottle of Shout on top of the washer as well. Someone really wanted to get rid of this stain. 

You're eager to ask around to figure out who was wearing the clothes.
