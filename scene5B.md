# WHODUNNIT

Keenan killed his wife. It's another case of a jealous and angry husband not being able to control his emotions and just walk away.

He could have left. He could have just never spoke to her again. 

After you have already left the room, you hear commotion coming from Keenan's interrogation room.

You walk up as he is getting arrested and he reiterates, "I DIDN'T DO THIS ALONE!"

You finally give in to his theory that he wasn't alone and you let him speak
