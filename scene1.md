### ðŸ”Ž The Arrival 

Upon arriving on scene everyone is gathered in the main living room with a tense energy filling the room. You head to go investigate the body which is located in the guest bedroom which **Keenan Kearson** and the victim were staying. 

As you enter the room, you notice all bedrooms need a key card to enter and there is no sign of forced entry. The murder weapon is laying next to the victims body which happens to be a Chef's knife. You bag the murder weapon and send it off to the lab for examination. You don't discover any other potential incriminating evidence so you decide to head out.

Now, do you leave the house and wait for the labs to comeback for the murder weapon?
Go seperate everyone and question them individually?
Investigate the rest of the house?
