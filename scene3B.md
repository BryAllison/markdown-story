### ðŸš¨ Questioning Tom 


He was angry but crying at the same time. Some might say that is signs of guilt.

The way he is acting could be all you need to try and push for a confession.

Tom mentions that his emotions are due to everyone finding out about the affair and how he betrayed his bestfriend Keenan by sleeping with his wife

"I found out that everyone knew and that Keenan knew and he had a look in his eyes that was frightening"

From what is being told to you, everyone is still a subject!
