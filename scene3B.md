# WHODUNNIT

You first give your condolences to Keenan on the loss of his wife.

He was angry but crying at the same time. Some might say that is signs of guilt.

The way he is acting could be all you need to try and push for a confession.

Keenan mentions that his emotions are due to his wife's 2 coworkers just telling him earlier that Brittney was sleeping with Tom at work and that his baby wasn't his baby. 

"They randomly walked up to me in the club and told me that and I lost it. I approached her about it and she quickly left. I just stood there and looked for Tom, he smiled back not knowing that I know so I went outside to calm down"

Hmmm ðŸ¤” Does he realize he just changed his story? I thought he was just told this information?? but the 2 coworkers did say Tom smiled and instantly frowned and stormed out. 

From what is being told to you, everyone is still a subject!
