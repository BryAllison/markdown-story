### ‚ùì Questioning 

You bring everyone outside to question seperately to find out there where-abouts.

Keenan and Lisa were together the whole night. Lisa mentioned Tom leaving the nightclub with Brittney at around 10pm and returning alone at 11pm. Tom said he never seen Brittney leave that night as he had work calls to make.

Tom said he was with Lisa in the nightclub until she left around 10pm to go to bed. Then he said he was with Keenan for the remainder of the night. Keenan stated that Tom left at the same time as Brittney and that Brittney called her and told her Tom just gave her a promotion.

Brittneys Co-workers **Rachel and Leah** said they were with Brittney the entire night. Up until Brittney went to bed. They never left the nightclub, they were still there when Brittney was discovered. 

You notice some obvious inconsistencies between Tom, Lisa and Keenan's stories. Choose who to bring back to the station to further interrogate.
