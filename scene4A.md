### ðŸ”¥ Applying Pressure 

TOM WAS SLEEPING WITH BRITTNEY. KEENAN AND LISA SOUNDS REHEARSED. GET DEEPER INTO QUESTIONS WITH THE SPOUSE AS THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE CULPRIT.

You show Tom a crime scene photo of Brittney and ask him "How could you do this to the woman you say you loved?" Tom starts to bounce his leg up and down, you can tell your're starting to get under his skin a little. You push it a step further and mumble "You know we got a finger print on the knife and it comes back to you Tom."

Tom snaps and stands up with his hands handcuffed to the interrogation table. He shouts "OK I DID IT, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?" 

Tom completely breaks down as you start to pack up the case files to head out. You got a full confession and thats all you needed. You have motive, his alibi doesn't check out, a murder weapon and a body. 

As you're walking out, Tom yells, "WAIT! Someone helped me do it for their own personal gain"
