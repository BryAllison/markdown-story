### ðŸ”¥ Applying Pressure 

KEENAN JUST SWITCHED HIS STORY. TOM AND LISA SOUNDS REHEARSED. GET DEEPER INTO QUESTIONS WITH THE SPOUSE AS THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE CULPRIT.

You show Keenan a crime scene photo of Brittney and ask him "How could you do this to your wife?" Keenan starts to bounce his leg up and down, you can tell your're starting to get under his skin a little. You push it a step further and mumble "You know we got a finger print on the knife and it comes back to you Keenan."

Keenan snaps and stands up with his hands handcuffed to the interrogation table. He shouts "OK I DID IT, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?" 

Keenan completely breaks down as you start to pack up the case files to head out. You got a full confession and thats all you needed. You have motive, his alibi doesn't check out, a murder weapon and a body. 

Just as you're about to leave the room.... Keenan says quietly "But I wasn't alone though."


Will you leave the room completely and book Keenan for murder or Will you sit back down and hear him out?
