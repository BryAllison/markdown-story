### ðŸš© Tom and Lisa left the room

You realize that Tom and Lisa have disappeared when the lights went out. You run after them assuming they're headed out the front door. 

Luckily they dont get far because Lisa tripped down the steps running out of the house. You ask with authority."Why are you running away?"

Before you can even get any more words out Tom shouts, "She pulled me out of the room as soon as the lights went out. I have no reason to run."

So you direct your attention to Lisa, as you look at her thinking of the words to say she just looks guilty. Almost as if she cant hide it anymore. So you ask her to come down to the station for further questioning. She agrees to come with without resisting.

You get to the stations interrogation room. Lisa is sitting there anxiously. You start off strong with "Lisa I know you did it, I just want to know the why."
She instantly gets defensive and states that she did not kill Brittney but she was a part of it. She states that Keenan killed her but Lisa helped plan it. Keenan tried to frame Lisa by using the knife Brittney uses every day, washing blood-stained clothes in Brittneys washer, and knew Lisa did not do well under pressure. Lisa stated that she wanted a deal. Not a murder charge. You tell her that you don't have that kind of authority. 

Now all that is left to do is book Keenan and Lisa for murder. Let the court handle the rest.
