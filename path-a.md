## EPISODE 2 - I KNOW YOUR SECRETS!

You ask Tom all sorts of questions in his office with the doors closed and he is denying, denying, and denying. You finally get enough of his pandering and yell, "STOP IT!" and you scream "I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HIDING TOM, I KNOW YOUR SECRETS!" 

Tom pleads that he is innocent and he would never hurt the love of his life or his unborn child.

Lisa over hears and freaks out on Tom and angrily attacks him. She starts spilling secrets that she have been having an affair with Brittney as well and that she was the love of her life. 

So if they both were in love with Brittney and wouldn't have killed her, who is left as a suspect? Was Tom still the killer? Was it Lisa?
