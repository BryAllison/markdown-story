### ðŸ’¡ Trusting your intuition 

You know that this is a risky move and not the correct way to do an investigation. You just have a very strong gut feeling of who murdered Brittney. Although you have no motive, no valid piece of evidence other than Keenan had a disagreement with Brittney hours prior to her murder. You just can't ignore the hunch. 

Who do you think is responsible for the murder of Brittney Kearson?
